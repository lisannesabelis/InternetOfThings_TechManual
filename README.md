# InternetOfThings_TechManual
This is for a course I followed at school. These are attempts at making a manual to create something in Arduino.
I couldn't manage to make the manual that matched my UI document.
Because of that I made a manual about changing the color of the lights on a LEDstrip with Telegram :).
